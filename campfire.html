<p>This was the libraries project and this was the one I had the most fun with out of all the websites this semester. Since this week, I have spent more time working on this website, continually adding new things for fun! The alien and marshmallow stick only appear on the screen when you hover the mouse over the chair, and the marshmallow slowly turns from white, to golden brown, then to black and falls off the stick into the fire. It is still a work in progress, but I am continuing to work on it!</p>
